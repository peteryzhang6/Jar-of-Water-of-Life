# Jar of Water of Life Phases

# Saturation Phase
Observation as of 11-17-2024 Sun

The fruits will stay afloat and will produce bubbles for few days or a week, then the rate of bubbles being produced will slow down and eventually come to a stop.

The skin of tomato and grapes will rip.
# Transformation Phase
Observation as of 11-17-2024 Sun

For a few days or weeks, some of the fruits will start to fall to the bottom of the jar during night and rise again during the day under sunlight.

Then this phase will end with all fruits at the bottom. And white particles will start to form around the fruits' skins.

Assumption: To accelerate the time from saturation to transformation phase, one will need to create water with fruit peels left in it for days or weeks.
# Fermentation(Decomposing) Phase
Observations and assumptions as of 11-17-2024 Sun

For time unknown the fruits will stay at the bottom and start to break down by the microorganisms in white forms.
# Unity Phase
Observations and assumptions as of 11-17-2024 Sun

The water should start to take a color based on the mixture of the fruits and sunlight should not (?) pass through the glass jar.
