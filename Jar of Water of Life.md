# Jar of Water of Life

An experimental water that brings eternal life to the ones who drink it.
# Theory
**The Creation of Water of Life through fruits**
- Put fruits of colors from the rainbow in such ratios that the unity of these colors is that of sunlight or rainbow. 
- Then put the glass jar that contains the fruits under sunlight 
- Allow the jar to bath under the sun during the day
	- and bath under the moonlight during night
	- to avoid light contamination during night by human made lights, cover the jars up in total darkness
- Through time, the fruits should break down 
- When all fruits are broken down, the water should be turned into that of a nectar
- This nectar is the Water of Life
# Reasons & Assumptions

- The main or underlying reason or logic is formed via a comprehensive understanding of the **Law of One**
	- it is hard to explain this reason thus reading Law of One is highly recommended
- Seen how people switching diet to vegetarian or all fruits or a diet with a certain property, I see that our body has the ability to adept to the food intake and adjust accordingly to increase the food ingestion efficiency.
	- like Ra said something as such: *as we approach 4th Density, our body will become better with food ingestion such that only water is needed*.
	- to interpret Ra's saying with modern science, I see that the microorganisms that grow within the water will take home in our guts, thus when our gut is fully covered with these microorganisms, which they form an ecosystem in our guts, their death will be used as our body's energy
	- or it can be that our guts establish a symbiosis relation with the microorganisms
- I see the water gets unclear when I left the orange peels in the jar for 1 day. I assume in science perspective it is the microorganisms or bacterias. So when I drink it, I am washing away my stomach acid and replacing all the organism and bacterias in my guts with ones that can survive on water. 
- I assume that stomach acid is there only to there to break down harder contents 
- From the understanding of Law of One, I can see that the fruits as representation of a density ray showing. For example: Tomato is red as all the rest of the 6 density rays are in potential and red ray is the one activated. Thus I make a break down of fruits based on which ray is activated:
	- red ray
		- tomatos
		- strawberry
	- orange ray
		- orange
		- tangerine 
		- mango?
	- yellow ray
		- lemon
		- pineapple
		- banana (maybe its a 6D manifestation as Ra said 6D has a golden color of white)
	- green ray
		- kiwi
		- green grape 
		- honeydew melon 
	- blue ray
		- blue berry
	- indigo ray
		- mixture of blue and violet
	- violet ray
		- grape
			- black berry 
- To further breakdown the rays based on the color of the skin and the color of the meat, I assume that, for example, apple is one that is red ray activated outer manifestation and yellow ray activated inner manifestation. For kiwi, we can assume is red and green activated outer manifestation and green ray activated inner manifestation.

# Possible Experiment and Usage
- we can have jars of single fruit; jars of 2 fruits combined; jars of 3 and so on; jars of a density color ray; jars of 2 density color ray mixed; jars of 3 and so on to 7; a grand jar of all the fruits on earth broken down along with skin and mixed together with water.
- to use these waters, we find behaviors in beings that shown if it is in 1D or 2D or so on, if it is lacking in 1D, then red water or blood water. If it is overwhelming in 5D, then 3D or yellow or golden water. If it is lacking in red and yellow, then orange is given. if one is almost at a balance then the water of the grand jar should be given, but the amount given should be accordance to each one's own vechile.

- to expand on the ideas of the location of the jars of eternal water: 
	- if a fruit is grown in North America, then the jar should be made in North America 
	- if a fruit is grown in desert, then the jar should be made in the very desert 
	- a jar of a location should contain all possible fruits find within it
	- a jar of a continent should contain all ... within it
	- the jar of the north is all fruits found in North of the globe
	- the jar of the south is all fruits found in South of the globe 
	- One drinks the yin and yang to obtain eternal life
	- or if one dont want to build jars, then just dump all the extra fruits into the sea
		- let the fishes know the wonder of the land and may one day they may walk the land with their own feet 
		- one day the ocean might be purified and one can just drink any water, like garden of eden in the old days
		
- to expand on the ideas of making the jars of water of life:
	- the fruit put into the jar should not be cut or else creates separation 
	- a jar can contain as many fruits as possible 
		- the water can be seen as the space which the star, or the fruit, floats in.
		- a jar with one fruit 
			- a jar with an tomatos 
				- 1D - birth of a star 
			- a jar with an orange 
				- 2D 
			- a jar with a lemon 
				- 3D
			- and so on
		- a jar with two or more of the same fruits
			- for example: 3 fruits of different size - 3 body problem 
		- a jar with a mixture of fruits is that one of galaxy or universe 
		- when does a jar become ready to drink?
			- when the sunlight passes through the jar becomes that of the desired color 
				- for example 
				- orange = orange 
				- tomato = red
				- lemon = yellow 
				- tomato + lemon = orange 
				- so on with the color combination

- another theory to be considered is that orange is orange because it is lacking in itself the orange ray thus orange ray is reflected. tomato lack red ray thus red ray is reflected. grape lacks violet thus. so on.
	- so if someone drink the rainbow water, then shows behavior of a beast, then that means it's red ray is overwhelming, thus feeding the tomato drink will increase all other rays for the being to reach a balance.

## Ideal Structure of the Jar 
The jar should be like the one i have right now but a tube is on top to collect the air bubbles rising out of the fruits then this tube is connected back to the bottom of the jar with an opening when the pressure above is high enough, it is enough to push open this opening and puts air back into the jar.
