# [[Jar of Water of Life ]]- Experiment 1

**Observation of Original The 4 Jars (10-21-2024)**
# Assumptions
- The jars will need to be closed/sealed for at least one year to bath in the spirit of the 4 seasons
- The water should appear to reflect a golden white color after a year 
- (10-30-2024 Wed) Looking at how wines are made, it usually takes 3-4 months or even longer for fermentation to start and one year for the wine to be ready, so for mine, at least 1 year need to go by before I can taste it.

# Mistakes
- the lids were not sealed tight and air (oxygen?) were able to escape
# 10-21-2024 Mon
- Created 4 jars
	- 1 tomato for red
	- 1 orange for orange
	- 1 lemon for yellow
	- 1 lime for green
	- 5 blueberry for blue
	- 3 blueberry and 3 grapes for indigo
	- 7 grapes for violet
	- ash of cig for yin or death
	- some air bubbles for yang or life
	- the water used was not tap water but the old water made with oranges peels 
- I did not cut the fruits is to avoid the pain of separation felt by the cells of the fruits.
- when will the water be ready to drink? IDK. I assume as the enzyme within starts to break down all the fruits completely and the water should shine a golden white color as Ra stats that 5D body survives on that of a nectar?

# 10-22-2024 Tue
- i see there are air bubbles attached to the fruits, which i assume is the oxygen, unlike days before i only had peels, and no air formed on the peel, which is dead water or idk. So the fruits are alive and producing oxygen. Within the sealed jar, the oxygen will be compressed into the jar alone with vitamins of that of water, then as i drink it, the oxygen will be absorbed by my gut, allowing better oxygen absorption along with the lung.
- 1747: the air pressure is building up and there are also bacterias forming of milky matter. the bacterias fall into the bottom. the lid of one jar is leaking water when i moved it and another is leaking air then i tightened it.
- with the bacteria, I assume once the jar is complete, the water should reflect a golden color

# 10-23-2024 Wed
- removed the paper label within the 4th jar 
- all limes rose to the top and mostly some grapes at the bottom 
- noticed the lids are loosing as the pressure inside is building up
- i hear the jar sizzling as the air is leaking out and little droplet of water is pushed out. so if left long enough, it will reach a point where the air and the water inside is balanced out without tightening the lid again?
- the water is getting cloudier than days before
	
# 10-24-2024 Thu
- in the morning, the limes turned partically into a yellow brown color
- one of the jar is coming to life as there are many tiny bubbles rising out of the water, not out of the fruits. This jar is less clear than others. 
- I opened the lids to led air out and did not screw it so tightly this time.

# 10-25-2024 Fri
- the lime has turned yellow and the green is wearing off. the lime in 3rd jar fell. more grapes rose to the top. 
- the water is getting less clear more milky
- there is no air bubbles coming out of the fruits anymore. i assume the ecosystem within the jar has reached an equalibrium and the transformation is starting.

# 10-26-2024 Sat
- three of the limes fell to the bottom and one jar both lime and orange fell. Then later both the lime and orange in that jar rose.
- very little air bubbles. the water seems to get thicker and no concentrated light is shown in the shadow
- To think of Ra said that they have a different definition for galaxy and universe; now i can see that each jar i create is a galaxy or universe. The 4 jars created on 10-21-2024 were mini galaxies and if with a jar large enough, i can create a miniture universe.

# 10-27-2024 Sun
- There is significant change in the jars. 
- The jar with both lime and orange fell to the both and rose up later on yesterday, the both fell and never rose today.
- In one jar, the tomato skin came off and air bubbles were forming under sunlight.

# 10-28-2024 Mon
- There is no significant change in the jars in the morning and in the evening

# 10-29-2024 Tue
- There is no significant change; 
	- jar from right to left is 1 to 4
	- in Jar 1, the color is more yellow milky color
	- in jar 2, the color is more red milky color 
	- in jar 3 and 4, the color is milky color
	
# 10-30-2024 Wed
- There is no significant changes 
- I noticed there are some white spots appearing on the fruits, probably was there days ago

# 10-31-2024 Thu
- In jar 2, all the fruits fell to the bottom. There are white particles on the orange, lemon, and tomato.
- From this point onward, if there is no significant changes, no dates will be recorded.

# 11-05-2024 Tue
- In jar 1, all fruits except tomato is sinking to the bottom

# 11-06-2024 Wed
- noticed jar 1's lid is loose

# 11-14-2024 Thu
- noticed the light out of jar 3 and 4 is one of red to yellow; while jar 2's light is dispersed, and jar 1 is unclear.

# 11-15-2024 Fri
1020~: The lemon and orange fell to the bottom in jar 4 and the concentration of sunlight through the jar disappeared and produces a dim light like those of jar 1. I assume the concentration of light is due to the bottom of the jar being empty. Less light passing through can be it is being absorbed by entities within the jar.
1455: about 1-2 hours ago, the lemon and orange in jar 4 rose
